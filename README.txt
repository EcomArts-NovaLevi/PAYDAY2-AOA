Dr. Peterson's Full Telekill Arsenal - Weapon Overhaul

This mod for PAYDAY 2 is an overhaul to most all of the weapons in PAYDAY 2 as of the date of the latest update!

The aim of this mod originally was not balance, but rather just to mod the weapons in a way that myself and my friends find fun.  I am well aware that aspects of it could be destructive and unbalanced.

As of recent, I have aimed to add balance by making most weapons deal more damage (but not too much damage) so that you may feel you can pick up a number of weapons you think fits your build on Death Wish and Death Sentence without having to feel like there are only so many single digit effective options.  These balances are relative to other weapons in their category and partially to similar weapons in other categories too.
